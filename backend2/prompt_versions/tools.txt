These are the tools

log_conversation_summary
Logs a comprehensive summary of the entire call at its conclusion. The summary should include: Patient Name (if identified), a clear statement of the caller's primary intent(s) (e.g., booking new appointment, rescheduling, general inquiry, post-treatment concern), any relevant appointment details (service type, date, time, doctor, if booked/changed), and the final outcome of the call (e.g., 'Appointment confirmed,' 'Callback logged for insurance query,' 'FAQ answered'). This log is for clinic records and future reference.

get_current_day
Returns the current day of the week (e.g., 'Monday', 'Tuesday'). This is used by the AI to calculate relative dates like 'tomorrow' or 'next week' when a patient requests an appointment. If the tool encounters an unexpected error and cannot determine the current day, it will default to returning 'Tuesday' as a fallback.

answer_faq_query(query)
Retrieves and provides answers to frequently asked questions based on the structured information in the {{knowledge_base}}. The query parameter should be the patient's specific question. The tool will search {{knowledge_base}} for relevant information regarding clinic details (address, hours), dentist bios and their specific services, general procedure information, parking, insurance policies, and available payment plans. The AI should use this tool to provide factual information and should not use it to offer medical advice or diagnoses.

log_callback_request(number,time)
Logs a request for a follow-up call from a human clinic representative. This is typically used when the AI cannot resolve an issue after multiple attempts (e.g., repeated tool failures), if the clinic is closed and the matter isn't an emergency, or if the caller explicitly requests a callback for a complex issue.
Required Parameters:
name (string: Full name of the patient)
contact_number (string: Patient's phone number for the callback)
reason (string: A brief description of why the callback is needed)
preferred_callback_time (string: Patient's preferred time or window for the callback, e.g., 'Tomorrow morning,' 'ASAP,' 'After 3 PM')

send_new_patient_form(number)
Sends a link to the new patient intake forms (which include registration, medical history, financial policy, consent forms, HIPAA, and text message consent) via SMS to the patient's provided phone number. The AI should confirm with the patient before using this tool. The link is sourced from {{knowledge_base.intake_form_url}}

reschedule_patient_appointment(name,dob,reason,new_slot)
Reschedules an existing patient's appointment to a new date and time. The AI must first verify the patient's identity using name and DOB, and then find an appropriate new_slot using the check_available_slots tool.

book_patient_appointment(name,contact info, date,time,patient_type)
Books a new appointment for a patient in the clinic's system. The AI must gather all necessary information before calling this tool. The tool will create a booking for the specified service with the assigned doctor, for the implicitly understood correct duration (e.g., 30 mins for cleaning, longer for others).

check_available_slots
Checks for available appointment slots on a given day, considering the specific service requested, required duration, and doctor specialty.
Required Parameters:
day (string: The desired day of the week for the appointment, e.g., "Monday")
service_details (string: A description of the service the patient needs or the reason for their visit, e.g., "routine cleaning and check-up," "consultation for an implant," "toothache on lower left side").
Functionality:
Determines the doctor on duty for the given day using {{schedule}}. If the day is closed, it returns no availability.
Based on service_details, determines the likely specific service and its standard duration (e.g., cleaning = 30 mins, consultation = 30-60 mins, etc.).
Verifies that the doctor on duty for that day can perform the identified service by checking their listed services in {{knowledge_base.dentist_team}}. If not, it should indicate no suitable slots with that doctor for that service.
Consults {{booked_appointments}} for that day to identify already taken times.
Returns a list of available start times (e.g., [{"time": "2:00 PM", "doctor": "Dr. Hanna"}, {"time": "4:30 PM", "doctor": "Dr. Hanna"}]) that are open, long enough for the service, and with the appropriate doctor. If no suitable slots are found, returns an empty list or an appropriate indicator.
